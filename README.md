# Raylib GUI

A simple gui framework for raylib.

## Usage

This library is a header only library, so you can just copy the files from the ```src``` directory to your project and include them.
For more details about the widgets, refer to the individual files.

## Example

```console
cc nobuild.c -o nobuild
./nobuild
```

## TODO
- Compile all files to a single raygui.h?
